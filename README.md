# FizzBuzz TDD Implementation

## To-Do List:
1. **Handle regular numbers**: If a number is not a multiple of 3 or 5, it should return the number itself as a string.
2. **Handle multiples of 3**: If a number is a multiple of 3, it should return `"Fizz"`.
3. **Handle multiples of 5**: If a number is a multiple of 5, it should return `"Buzz"`.
4. **Handle multiples of both 3 and 5**: If a number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it should return `"FizzBuzz"`.

## Steps:
- First, I wrote a failing test for regular numbers (not divisible by 3 or 5).
- Then, I implemented the simplest code to make the test pass.
- We added tests for multiples of 3, 5, and both 3 and 5.
- Refactored and committed after each step.
